### Self Introduction
I’m excited to share my journey with you—a path that has been shaped by a passion for both science and technology. In 2017, I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from Loyola University Chicago, drawn to the intricate science behind how things work. That passion led me into the biotechnology industry, where I supported pharmaceutical companies in the drug development process.

While working in the field, I began noticing opportunities to improve how we managed and visualized our data. This curiosity sparked my interest in computer science. I started experimenting with Microsoft Workflow, SharePoint rules, and Power BI dashboards to streamline our data operations. Through this hands-on experience, I discovered a new fascination: data science.

Determined to bridge my scientific background with emerging technologies, I made the decision to pursue a second degree in Computer Science—all while working full time. It’s been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I’m proud to be graduating in just a few weeks.

Combining biochemistry and computer science has opened the door to a fulfilling career in data science within the pharmaceutical space. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to innovations at the intersection of science and technology.

### Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout my computer science program, completing coursework and building my ePortfolio has been instrumental in shaping my technical skillset, professional identity, and long-term career goals. The combination of hands-on projects, collaborative experiences, and rigorous academic challenges has not only helped me showcase my strengths but also prepared me to confidently enter the computer science field with a well-rounded foundation.

One of the most valuable aspects of the program was the opportunity to collaborate in team environments, simulating real-world software development scenarios. In several courses, including Software Engineering and Capstone, I worked in agile teams to design and implement complex applications. These experiences taught me how to delegate tasks effectively, resolve conflicts constructively, and deliver code as part of a larger, cohesive system—critical skills for any software engineering role.

Clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders was another key area of growth. Whether drafting design documents, presenting technical proposals, or participating in code reviews, I learned to articulate my ideas in ways that align with stakeholder goals. For example, in a database management project, I communicated schema design and data flow to a hypothetical client, ensuring clarity between user needs and technical implementation.

Core coursework in data structures and algorithms further refined my problem-solving abilities. Implementing custom data structures such as hash maps and balanced trees, and optimizing algorithms for time and space complexity, gave me a strong computational foundation that I now apply to tasks like debugging, code optimization, and system design.

My training in software engineering and database systems taught me how to approach software lifecycle development with a structured methodology. From version control and documentation to relational and non-relational database integration, I gained practical experience that aligns with industry standards. I also learned how to manage project timelines and deliverables, which is essential for maintaining professional accountability and productivity.

Lastly, my coursework in cybersecurity heightened my awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure software development. Learning about authentication protocols, encryption methods, and risk mitigation strategies helped me internalize the importance of building resilient systems and protecting user data—knowledge I consider crucial as technology becomes increasingly integrated with personal and societal infrastructure.

Together, these experiences have shaped my values around teamwork, ethical development, and lifelong learning. They’ve helped me clarify my goal of contributing to impactful, secure, and efficient technologies—and to continuously evolve as a professional in the computer science field.


### Refinement Plan and Code Review

### Artifacts
When reviewing artifacts from my computer science program, one stood out the most to me. When I started the program, I had to create pseudocode to help a pet company with a check in and check out process. Using the pseudocode from this class, I thought it would be a great idea to develop a mobile application utilizing Android Studio. I enjoyed using Android Studio to create an inventory application for a different class and believed it would be enjoyable and also show skills that I have developed in my computer science degree career. A quote by Steve Jobs comes to mind, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." By combining my enjoyment of utilizing Android Studio with my knowledge of Java script, I could develop the application to the pseudocode. By developing the application from scratch, I was able to enhance the software design and engineering by creating the mobile application. The artifact was improved as I turned pseudocode into code.  By utilizing my knowledge in software engineering and development, algorithms and structures, and databases, I was able to create the start of something new. As my graduation day approaches, I hope to continue to work on this project and enhance it as I have from pseudocode.

#### Original Artifact
[Original Pseudocode IT-145 Artifact](Original_Artifact_Pseudocode.docx "Original Artifact Pseudocode")

This project had me write pseudocode that lays out a plan for the pet check in method. Based on the pseudocode I wrote, I then created a flowchart for the Pet Check In method. The flowchart helps my team communicate how we are planning to develop the software for our client. The flowchart includes start and end points, appropriate decision branching, and alignment with the Pet Check In process pseudocode.

#### Pet Hotel Application
[Capstone Project](Pet_Hotel_Android_Studio_Application.zip "Capstone Final Project")

To create an application that a pet hotel could utilize, I first conducted user interviews to understand what customers of the application would look for. I contacted some pet boarding services in my area and learned that they would like to have an employee registration database, a screen for available rooms with regards to the pets, ability to add more pet types and update existing pet types in case they expand. I have accomplished creating these user wants in the application. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Employee Registration Account.jpg" width="300px" title="Employee Registration Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Log In Screen.jpg" width="300px" title="Log In Screenshot" />
    <p><em>Figure 2 - Employee Registration and Log In Screen Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

As employees register, their information will be stored in the employee database. Here you can see the database that is created when I register as an employee of the pet hotel.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Databases.jpg" width="300px" title="Databases Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><em>Figure 3 - Databases and User Database Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

After the employee logs into the application, they are directed to the home screen where they can choose one of two options. The second option is not fully completed, just added in to the screen shot to show the potential the application has. The employee will choose Pet Space Availability and be directed to this screen.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Home Screen.jpg" width="300px" title="Home Screen Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><em>Figure 4 - Home Screen and Pet Availability Screenshots</em></p>
</div> 

At the Pet Availability Screen, the user can add a new pet type with available space information, or edit an existing pet type by clicking the item they would like to edit. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Add New Pet Type to DB.jpg" width="300px" title="Add New Pet Type Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Update Pet Type in DB.jpg" width="300px" title="Update Pet Type Screenshot" />
    <p><em>Figure 5 - Add New Pet Type and Update Pet Type Screenshots</em></p>
</div> 

As the Pet Types are added in the application, they are also added to the Pet Space Availability Database.

While I have accomplished these goals, I would like to continue building on it to allow the pet boarders to use the application for Pet Check In and Pet Check Out. As I finish my degree and work towards shifting my focus to a major career change, I will continue to work on this project. I hope to launch it on the Android App store so that Pet Hotel or boarding services can utilize it.
