#### Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout my computer science program, completing coursework and building my ePortfolio has been instrumental in shaping my technical skillset, professional identity, and long-term career goals. The combination of hands-on projects, collaborative experiences, and rigorous academic challenges has not only helped me showcase my strengths but also prepared me to confidently enter the computer science field with a well-rounded foundation.

One of the most valuable aspects of the program was the opportunity to collaborate in team environments, simulating real-world software development scenarios. In several courses, including Software Engineering and Capstone, I worked in agile teams to design and implement complex applications. These experiences taught me how to delegate tasks effectively, resolve conflicts constructively, and deliver code as part of a larger, cohesive system—critical skills for any software engineering role.

Clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders was another key area of growth. Whether drafting design documents, presenting technical proposals, or participating in code reviews, I learned to articulate my ideas in ways that align with stakeholder goals. For example, in a database management project, I communicated schema design and data flow to a hypothetical client, ensuring clarity between user needs and technical implementation.

Core coursework in data structures and algorithms further refined my problem-solving abilities. Implementing custom data structures such as hash maps and balanced trees, and optimizing algorithms for time and space complexity, gave me a strong computational foundation that I now apply to tasks like debugging, code optimization, and system design.

My training in software engineering and database systems taught me how to approach software lifecycle development with a structured methodology. From version control and documentation to relational and non-relational database integration, I gained practical experience that aligns with industry standards. I also learned how to manage project timelines and deliverables, which is essential for maintaining professional accountability and productivity.

Lastly, my coursework in cybersecurity heightened my awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure software development. Learning about authentication protocols, encryption methods, and risk mitigation strategies helped me internalize the importance of building resilient systems and protecting user data—knowledge I consider crucial as technology becomes increasingly integrated with personal and societal infrastructure.

Together, these experiences have shaped my values around teamwork, ethical development, and lifelong learning. They’ve helped me clarify my goal of contributing to impactful, secure, and efficient technologies—and to continuously evolve as a professional in the computer science field.

#### Artifacts
When reviewing artifacts from my computer science program, one stood out the most to me. When I started the program, I had to create pseudocode to help a pet company with a check in and check out process. Using the pseudocode from this class, I thought it would be a great idea to develop a mobile application utilizing Android Studio. I enjoyed using Android Studio to create an inventory application for a different class and believed it would be enjoyable and also show skills that I have developed in my computer science degree career. A quote by Steve Jobs comes to mind, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." By combining my enjoyment of utilizing Android Studio with my knowledge of Java script, I could develop the application to the pseudocode. By developing the application from scratch, I was able to enhance the software design and engineering by creating the mobile application. The artifact was improved as I turned pseudocode into code.  By utilizing my knowledge in software engineering and development, algorithms and structures, and databases, I was able to create the start of something new. As my graduation day approaches, I hope to continue to work on this project and enhance it as I have from pseudocode.

##### Original Artifact
[Original Pseudocode IT-145 Artifact](Original_Artifact_Pseudocode.docx "Original Artifact Pseudocode")

This project had me write pseudocode that lays out a plan for the pet check in method. Based on the pseudocode I wrote, I then created a flowchart for the Pet Check In method. The flowchart helps my team communicate how we are planning to develop the software for our client. The flowchart includes start and end points, appropriate decision branching, and alignment with the Pet Check In process pseudocode.
