### Self Introduction
I’m excited to share my journey with you—a path that has been shaped by a passion for both science and technology. In 2017, I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from Loyola University Chicago, drawn to the intricate science behind how things work. That passion led me into the biotechnology industry, where I supported pharmaceutical companies in the drug development process.

While working in the field, I began noticing opportunities to improve how we managed and visualized our data. This curiosity sparked my interest in computer science. I started experimenting with Microsoft Workflow, SharePoint rules, and Power BI dashboards to streamline our data operations. Through this hands-on experience, I discovered a new fascination: data science.

Determined to bridge my scientific background with emerging technologies, I made the decision to pursue a second degree in Computer Science—all while working full time. It’s been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I’m proud to be graduating in just a few weeks.

Combining biochemistry and computer science has opened the door to a fulfilling career in data science within the pharmaceutical space. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to innovations at the intersection of science and technology.

### Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout my computer science program, completing coursework and building my ePortfolio has been instrumental in shaping my technical skillset, professional identity, and long-term career goals. The combination of hands-on projects, collaborative experiences, and rigorous academic challenges has not only helped me showcase my strengths but also prepared me to confidently enter the computer science field with a well-rounded foundation.

One of the most valuable aspects of the program was the opportunity to collaborate in team environments, simulating real-world software development scenarios. In several courses, including Software Engineering and Capstone, I worked in agile teams to design and implement complex applications. These experiences taught me how to delegate tasks effectively, resolve conflicts constructively, and deliver code as part of a larger, cohesive system—critical skills for any software engineering role.

Clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders was another key area of growth. Whether drafting design documents, presenting technical proposals, or participating in code reviews, I learned to articulate my ideas in ways that align with stakeholder goals. For example, in a database management project, I communicated schema design and data flow to a hypothetical client, ensuring clarity between user needs and technical implementation.

Core coursework in data structures and algorithms further refined my problem-solving abilities. Implementing custom data structures such as hash maps and balanced trees, and optimizing algorithms for time and space complexity, gave me a strong computational foundation that I now apply to tasks like debugging, code optimization, and system design.

My training in software engineering and database systems taught me how to approach software lifecycle development with a structured methodology. From version control and documentation to relational and non-relational database integration, I gained practical experience that aligns with industry standards. I also learned how to manage project timelines and deliverables, which is essential for maintaining professional accountability and productivity.

Lastly, my coursework in cybersecurity heightened my awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure software development. Learning about authentication protocols, encryption methods, and risk mitigation strategies helped me internalize the importance of building resilient systems and protecting user data—knowledge I consider crucial as technology becomes increasingly integrated with personal and societal infrastructure.

Together, these experiences have shaped my values around teamwork, ethical development, and lifelong learning. They’ve helped me clarify my goal of contributing to impactful, secure, and efficient technologies—and to continuously evolve as a professional in the computer science field.


### Refinement Plan and Code Review
As I reviewed the artifacts from my computer science program, one project stood out above the rest. Early in the program, I was tasked with creating pseudocode for a pet company’s check-in and check-out process. That foundational assignment inspired me to take the project further by developing a mobile application using Android Studio. Having previously built an inventory app in Android Studio for another course—and thoroughly enjoying the experience—I saw an opportunity to merge that interest with the skills I had developed throughout the program. A quote by Steve Jobs resonated with me during this process: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” I genuinely enjoyed bringing this project to life. By combining my knowledge of Java, software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms, and database management, I transformed the original pseudocode into a functional mobile app. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply classroom concepts in a meaningful way and significantly improve the original artifact. As graduation approaches, I look forward to continuing this project, refining its features, and exploring its full potential—turning an academic assignment into something real and impactful.

### Artifacts

The following artifacts representi my growth in the Computer Science program at SNHU. The artifacts demonstrate enhancements in the following categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

#### Original Artifact
[Original Pseudocode IT-145 Artifact](Original_Artifact_Pseudocode.docx "Original Artifact Pseudocode")

This project involved designing the logic for a Pet Check-In method by first developing detailed pseudocode to outline the workflow. Based on that pseudocode, I created a corresponding flowchart to visually represent the process. The flowchart serves as a communication tool for my team, helping us align on how we plan to develop the software for our client. It includes clearly defined start and end points, logical decision branches, and full alignment with the original pseudocode, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the development process.

#### Pet Hotel Application
[Capstone Project](Pet_Hotel_Android_Studio_Application.zip "Capstone Final Project")

To create an application that a pet hotel could utilize, I first conducted user interviews to understand what customers of the application would look for. I contacted some pet boarding services in my area and learned that they would like to have an employee registration database, a screen for available rooms with regards to the pets, ability to add more pet types and update existing pet types in case they expand. I have accomplished creating these user wants in the application. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Employee Registration Account.jpg" width="300px" title="Employee Registration Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Log In Screen.jpg" width="300px" title="Log In Screenshot" />
    <p><em>Figure 2 - Employee Registration and Log In Screen Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

As employees register, their information will be stored in the employee database. Here you can see the database that is created when I register as an employee of the pet hotel.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Databases.jpg" width="300px" title="Databases Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><em>Figure 3 - Databases and User Database Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

After the employee logs into the application, they are directed to the home screen where they can choose one of two options. The second option is not fully completed, just added in to the screen shot to show the potential the application has. The employee will choose Pet Space Availability and be directed to this screen.

<div style="text-align: center;">

#### Narrative
[Narrative](Narratives_of_Progress_Updates.docx "Narrative")

The narrative that you will read is a combined document from my progress of enhancing the pseudocode. The narrative should explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and my reflection on the process I used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses less on the actual creation of the artifact and more on the learning that happened through the creation of the artifact. 

I chose this artifact for my capstone because it represents my growth throughout the computer science program. Originally created as pseudocode in an early course (IT-145), I decided to expand the concept into a fully functioning mobile application using Android Studio. This allowed me to showcase how I’ve applied my skills in software design, engineering, algorithms, data structures, and user-centered design.

One of the major challenges I faced was my limited experience with Android Studio, which led to persistent issues such as application crashes—especially when integrating multiple RecyclerViews and managing database functionality. Time constraints due to a demanding full-time job also made it difficult to troubleshoot and complete all intended features. Despite these setbacks, I’ve continued refining the application, using user feedback, A/B testing, and design trade-offs to prioritize functionality over aesthetics. I remain committed to improving the app and eventually launching it for real-world use in pet boarding services.

While I’ve already achieved several milestones with this project, I see it as just the beginning. I plan to continue developing the application to support full functionality for pet boarders, enabling seamless Pet Check-In and Check-Out processes. As I complete my degree and transition into a new phase of my career, I’m committed to refining and expanding the app. My ultimate goal is to launch it on the Android App Store, making it a valuable tool for pet hotels and boarding services to streamline their operations.
